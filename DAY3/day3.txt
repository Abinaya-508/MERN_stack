CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and design web pages. It controls how HTML elements look on a website, including colors, fonts, spacing, layout, and positioning.

CSS works by selecting HTML elements and applying styles to them using properties and values. A CSS rule consists of a selector (which targets the element) and a declaration block (which contains property–value pairs).

There are three main ways to add CSS:

1. Inline CSS – written inside an HTML element using the style attribute.
2. Internal CSS – written inside a `<style>` tag in the HTML document.
3. External CSS – written in a separate `.css` file and linked to the HTML file.

Selectors are used to target elements. Common selectors include:

* Element selector (e.g., `p`, `div`)
* Class selector (e.g., `.box`)
* ID selector (e.g., `#header`)

CSS properties control appearance, such as:

* color (text color)
* background-color
* font-size
* margin and padding
* border

The box model explains how elements are structured: content, padding, border, and margin.

CSS also supports layouts using display, position, flexbox, and grid.

In short, CSS makes web pages visually attractive and properly arranged.
